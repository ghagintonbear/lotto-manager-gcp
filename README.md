# Google Cloud Platform Lotto-Manager

Forked [lotto-manager](https://github.com/ghagintonbear/lotto-manager) to solve same problem using:
* GCP Async [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions),
* GCP GitHub gcloud actions for [CI/CD](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/cloud-build-brings-advanced-cicd-capabilities-to-github),
* [Cloud PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub),
* Store results in either Buckets to begin with. BigQuery later.
